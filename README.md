# daino-design
Personal portfolio website. This is designed and created by yours truly. I tried and aimed for the simplest UI for users to relate with easily. I also did it in react JS framework paired with a couple of dependencies I found along the way. The idea is to serve very simple websites that require absolutely no learning to be able to use.
